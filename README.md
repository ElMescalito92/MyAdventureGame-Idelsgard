# Idelsgard - My Adventure Game

My Final Project for the Python Introduction lessons in at Udacity's "Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program".  

## Instructions:

Run the program like this:  

    python3 Idelsgard.py

**Have Fun!**

## The Requirements

The Requirenments as stated by Udacity's [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2465/view) for the *Adventure Game* project.

### Project Rubric

The following are the specifications as enlisted in the Project Rubric.

### Code Review

- The descriptions are printed to the console for the player to see.
- The game uses the following functions:
  - The `time.sleep` function is used to create delays between messages so that they aren't all printed at once.
  - The `random.choice` or `random.randint` function is used to influence the game so that each game is different in some way.
- The game uses the input function in combination with conditional statements (e.g., if and while) to create an interactive program.
  - The input function is used to ask the player what they would like to do.
  - The player's choices affect what happens in the game, including:
    - Whether the player wins or loses.
    - Whether to restart or exit after the game is over.
- The game uses a conditional loop to handle invalid input. If the player enters a choice that is not valid, the game gives them the chance to retry until they enter a valid option. The game does not crash and does not treat invalid input as a valid choice.
- The program's code is refactored by defining and calling functions. The code includes at least four-function definitions that are used to improve the code in some way, such as by:
  - Reducing repetition
  - Reducing complexity
  - Improving the readability or organization of the code
- Each function should have a single purpose and a name that describes that purpose.
- The code written follows the standard Python Style Guide, such that `pycodestyle` tool reports zero errors and zero warnings.
- The program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.
